## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned elementary of semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, flexbox, media queries, optimal layout depending on device's screen size, hover and focus states for interactive elements


```css
  @media screen and (min-width: 90rem) {
             
    .perfume-presentation {
    margin: 0 auto; 
    max-width: 50%;
    border-radius: 10px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    margin-right: 20px;
    margin-left: 20px;
         }
  }

```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be more practice of concepts html, css and Javascript, responsive web design.
